## Statistics for Environmental and Climate Analysis with R

To understand the water cycle and climate changes impacts in urban
environments, whether from a hydrological, ecological or climatological
point of view, it is essential to have statistical skills to deal with
highly dynamic spatiotemporal variables. This course covers from
statistical concepts to applied methods applied to environmental and
climactic variables while helping the participants develop their skills
in R programming and data processing. The R codes and key references to
master the techniques and tools included in this course will be
available for the participants through a GitHub repository. In the end,
a workshop will allow participants to use their data and a method of
their choice with the instructors’ support.

**Duration:** 1.5 ECTS (15x45 min)

**Date:** April

### **Course program:**

**Introduction to R** *(non-compulsory)*\[1\]

  - R studio and R base: *R environment and essential functions*
  - R packages: *finding packages that suit your needs*
  - R markdown: *working with markdown files throughout the course*

**Data science overview**

  - Data structure: *determining statistics based on types of variables*
  - Data visualization: *plotting cool graphs according to the aim and
    variable type*
  - Exploratory Analysis: *finding relationships and identifying
    variable’s behaviour*
  - Modelling approaches: *explaining, predicting or forecasting?*

**Core concepts of statistics**

  - Random variables and probability distribution: *beyond Normal*
  - Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing: *samples, parameters
    and estimates*
  - Statistical Inference: *where all statistical conclusions rely on,
    classical or Bayesian*
  - Data modelling: *general assumptions, model selection and accuracy*

**Modelling climate events and time-series data**

  - Time-series data: *working with dates and time in R*
  - Extreme Values Analysis: *changes and intensity of extreme (or rare)
    events*
  - Time-series modelling: *dealing with seasonality and trends to
    forecast with ARIMA models*

**Regression models**

  - Generalized Additive Model (GAM): *smoothing your issues, study case
    application*
  - Machine Learning algorithms: *tuning parameters to control model
    complexity*
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM): *tuning cost and epsilon, study case
    application*

**Other statistical methods**

  - Multivariate Analysis: *Principal Components (PCA/PLSR), Cluster and
    Factorial Analysis*
  - What is still missing: *an overview of uncovering subjects such as
    spatial Analysis and DOE*

**Workshop** \* Hands-on: *working on your data and interest*

1.  non\*compulsory module with a duration of 2x45 minutes offers to
    help  
    the participants who are not familiar with R and R studio.
