# R studio and R base: R environment and essential functions

Let started with , a powerful open-source
software/language environment for statistics analysis ([R Development
Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)). R will be the
environment for all statistical and graphical techniques present in this
course.

## Concepts and bounds

The course will be using exclusively [R languange](https://www.r-project.org/) to the R through [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) interface (IDE). 
Despite no programming skills are really needed to follow the course and learn the statitistical concepts and techniques, 
basic knowledge in R/Rstudio will make the course much more pratical and dynamic.
