### R studio and R base: R environment and essential functions

#### Concepts and bounds

The course will be using exclusively [R languange](https://www.r-project.org/) through the interface of [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/)  (IDE). 
Despite no programming skills are really needed to follow the course and learn the statistical concepts and techniques, 
basic knowledge in R/Rstudio will make the course much more practical and dynamical.

#### References
If you want to have some basic knowledge in advance, you can check some friendly web books (i.e. bookdown) such as [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) or [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/getting-started-with-r.html)

#### Prerequesites
Installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) (see [course requirements](https://github.com/AlbyDR/UWI-CouRse/blob/main/Requirements.md).

### R packages: finding packages that suit your needs

This section will focus on data cleaning and processing using the tidy data concept.

For instance, 
``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
or through out the couRse with
``` r
packages_list2.1 <- c("tidyverse", "lubridate")

new.packages <- packages_list2.1[!(packages_list2.1 %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

invisible(lapply(packages_list2.1, library, character.only = T, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = F))
```
Package that should to be installed are in the packages_list_prior. 
``` r
packages_list_prior <- c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "kableExtra","scales", "tidyquant", "cowplot",
                       "gridExtra", "RColorBrewer", "colorspace", "summarytools", "corrr", "GGally",
                       "minerva", "magrittr", "vip", "tidymodels", "infer", "moderndive", "extRemes",
                       "bayesplot", "bayestestR", "rstanarm", "insight", "modelbased", "performance", 
                       "see", "car", "lmtest", "plsmod","mixOmics","modelbased", "performance", "see",
                       "randomForest","MASS", "corrr", "car", "e1071", "astsa")
                         
packages_list_priorII <- c("sp", "mapview", "webshot", "suncalc", "raster", "httr", "sf", "fasterize",                                    "rasterVis", "RColorBrewer", "geobuffer", "ggspatial")
```

###	R markdown: working with markdown files throughout the course

We will use file like this one .md to show the results that you should be able to run with
the code .R and the data .rds storage in this repository.
