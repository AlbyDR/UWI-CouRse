### R studio and R base: R environment and essential functions

#### Concepts and bounds

The course will be using exclusively [R languange](https://www.r-project.org/) through the interface of [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/)  (IDE). 
Despite no programming skills are really needed to follow the course and learn the statistical concepts and techniques, 
basic knowledge in R/Rstudio will make the course much more practical and dynamical.

#### References
If you want to have some basic knowledge in advance, you can check some friendly web books (i.e. bookdown) such as [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) or [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/getting-started-with-r.html)
