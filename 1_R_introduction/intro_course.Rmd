## R.1 First Things First 
If you do not already have R, point your browser to the Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN), http://cran.r-project.org/ and download and install it.
The installation includes help files and some user manuals. You can find helpful
tutorials by following CRANâ€™s link to Contributed Documentation. , then RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) will make using R easier.

# lets start 

```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4
6 + 9

# Calculate 2+ 4
6 + 3
```



# Arithmetic with R



  - Addition: +
  - Subtraction: -
  - Multiplication: *
  - Division: /
  - Exponentiation: ^
  - Modulo: %%
 
```{r}

4 ^4 
```

Type 28 %% 6 to calculate 28 modulo 6.
```{r}

56 %% 5
```


# Variable assignment 



```{r}

x <- 66

x
```




```{r}
ana_degree <- 5
```


```{r}
ana_degree 
```

# Variable assignment 



```{r}
arne_degree <- 7
```

Add the variables my_apples and my_oranges and have R simply print the result.
```{r}
ana_degree + arne_degree
```

Assign the result of adding my_apples and my_oranges to a new variable my_fruit.
```{r}
total <- ana_degree + arne_degree
```




```{r}

ana_degree<- 5 


arne_degree <- "six" 

(total <- ana_degree + arne_degree)
```

++ Adjust 
```{r}
arne_degree<- 6

total<-  ana_degree + arne_degree
```



# Basic data types in R
R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

Decimal values like 11.1 are called numerics.
Natural numbers like 11 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
Text (or string) values are called characters.

```{r}
n_numeric <- 11.1


```


```{r}
c_character <- "some text"
#change
c_character <- "universe"
```



```{r}
l_logical <- TRUE
# Change 
l_logical <- FALSE
```



# data type

```{r}

n_numeric <- 15
c_character <- "home"
l_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(n_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(c_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(l_logical)

```



# Create a vector


```{r}
num_vector <- c(14, 101, 419)
character_vector <- c("ab", "bc", "cd")


boolean_vector <-c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```


```{r}
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
numeric_v <- c(12, -5, 22, -72, 20)
# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
vv <- c(-21, -10, +20, -32, +13 )
```



# Naming a vector


```{r}
numeric_v <- c(12, -5, 22, -72, 20)

vv <- c(-21, -10, +20, -32, +13 )


day_v <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")


days_vv <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

```



```{r}
# The variable days_vector
days_v <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
 
# Assign the names of the day to roulette_vector and poker_vector
names(numeric_v) <- days_v  
names(vv) <-days_v
numeric_v
vv
```
