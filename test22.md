# R and RStudio

Let started with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a powerful open-source
software/language environment for statistics analysis ([R Development
Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)). R will be the
environment for all statistical and graphical techniques present in this
course.

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), which is an open-source integrated
development environment (IDE) for R, great facilitate code editing,
plotting visualization and workplace management. But if you are familiar
with another IDE or you are advanced user of R you may not need to
install Rstudio (but I do).

We also will use many contributed packages for different statistical
technique and data processing requirement. For more detail see [CRAN
package repository](https://cran.r-project.org/) (The Comprehensive R
Archive Network). Each course section we will include the packages
required to be installed in advance.
